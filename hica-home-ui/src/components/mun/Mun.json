      "p1": "Model United Nations, also known as Model UN or MUN, is an educational simulation and/or academic activity in which students can learn about diplomacy, international relations, and the United Nations. MUN involves and teaches participants speaking, debating, and writing skills, in addition to critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership abilities. Usually an extracurricular activity, some schools also offer Model UN as a class. It is meant to engage students and allow them to develop deeper understanding into current world issues.",
      "p2": "Participants in Model United Nations conferences, known as delegates, are placed in committees and assigned countries to represent, or occasionally other organizations or political figures, where they represent members of that body. They are presented with their assignments in advance, along with a topic or topics that their committee will discuss. Delegates conduct research before conferences and formulate positions that they will then debate with their fellow delegates in the committee, staying true to the actual position of the member they represent. At the end of a conference, the best-performing delegates in each committee, as well as delegations, are sometimes recognized with awards."

      "p2": "在会议当中，每个国家均可以派出一定数量的代表参加会议，并尝试在会议中将扮演世界各国外交官，在搜集资料后依现实或虚构的国际状况来模拟进行联合国中的各种会议，按照类似联合国会议的规则和程序进行发言、游说、辩论、谈判，国家集团间达成共识，产生决议草案，并按照联合国的表决程序进行投票从而形成决议。因此，参与者需要在会前的 4 到 9 个月里对所代表国家的国情、外交政策和会间将讨论的议题进行深入研究和充分准备，并完成立场文件的写作，同时出席所有正式会议前的工作会议。"
